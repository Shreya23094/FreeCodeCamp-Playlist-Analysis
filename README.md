### Overview of the project:
This project is about the playlist of FreeCodeCamp "[Beau Teaches Javascript](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLWKjhJtqVAbmoiNlqLJg1gxEjEuKHHcn_&si=ac8OSTrKBTEOR5R6)". We've used API the collection of the data that we require for the analysis.
Here after the collection of data, we've extracted the Video IDs, Name, date, views, likes, comments counts and tags.
In this project, we've used plotting to show the most used tags in the videos of the playlist.
Also, In this project to create a model, we've used Linear regression which shows the correlation between the prediction values of like and comment counts and target value of views.
